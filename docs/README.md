# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, iterative lifecycle consisting of five main phases: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, **Release**, and **Retrospective**. Initiation captures the problem definition, stakeholders, and success metrics using a Project One-Pager and an initiation checklist. Planning transforms the approved idea into a structured backlog with estimates, clear acceptance criteria, and a milestone roadmap.

Execution relies on a project board where work moves through stages such as Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done. Teams collaborate using pull requests, linking work to issues and ensuring traceability. Release management ensures safe deployment, documentation updates, and communication to relevant teams. Retrospectives help identify improvements, reduce risks, and refine processes.

Daily coordination includes standups focused on blockers and progress, weekly syncs between Product and Project Managers, and monthly stakeholder updates. Communication templates for weekly reports, incident notices, and risk logs improve consistency across teams. Risks, dependencies, and escalations are tracked using a simple, structured escalation model.

## Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)** — responsible for planning, execution tracking, risk management, and cross-team coordination.
- **Product Manager (PdM)** — defines product vision, prioritizes the backlog, aligns business goals, and communicates requirements.
- **Developers** — implement features, participate in code reviews, fix defects, and ensure work follows the Definition of Done.
- **Quality Assurance (QA)** — verifies functionality against acceptance criteria, performs testing, and ensures release quality.
- **Stakeholders** — business owners or representatives who review progress, approve milestones, and provide strategic input.

## Communication Strategy

OctoAcme maintains a structured communication flow:  
- Daily standups for progress and blockers  
- Weekly delivery or engineering syncs  
- Monthly stakeholder updates  
- Incident and escalation templates for urgent issues  

This ensures transparency, accountability, and predictable delivery.

## Quality Assurance Practices

QA at OctoAcme ensures consistent quality through:  
- Definition of Done (DoD)  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Peer reviews and PR-based workflows  
- Automated and manual testing  
- Release verification steps  

These practices ensure reliability and clarity across all project phases.
