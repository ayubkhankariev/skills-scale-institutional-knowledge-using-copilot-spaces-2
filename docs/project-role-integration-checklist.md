# Project Role Integration Checklist

Use this checklist when onboarding new team members or integrating new roles into a project:

- [ ] Document each team member’s role, responsibilities, and contact info
- [ ] Confirm understanding of project scope, deliverables, and goals
- [ ] Grant access to all required tools, repos, and documentation
- [ ] Introduce each new role to the team and key stakeholders
- [ ] Review communication channels and cadence
- [ ] Set up recurring cross-role check-ins (if needed)
- [ ] Align on handoffs, dependencies, and integration points
- [ ] Confirm success criteria and deliverables for every role

Refer to `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` for detailed definitions of each role.
